SGH-I927 / SGH-I927R TWRP Recovery
==========================================

This repository is the basis for building TWRP for the Samsung SGH-I927 (Captivate Glide).

Due to the current nature of the device, it is required to build the recovery outside of CyanogenMod itself, due to conflicting settings.  As this is the case, the path has been adjusted to SGHI927, rather than bose.

In the future this project may merge into the baseline CyanogenMod repository for the device.

Notes
=====

This is best used against the CM10 (JB) source....
