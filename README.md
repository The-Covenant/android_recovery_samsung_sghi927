SGH-I927 / SGH-I927R ClockworkMod Recovery
==========================================

This repository is the basis for building CWMR for the Samsung SGH-I927 (Captivate Glide).

Due to the current nature of the device, it is required to build the recovery outside of CyanogenMod itself, due to conflicting settings.  As this is the case, the path has been adjusted to SGHI927, rather than bose.

In the future this project may merge into the baseline CyanogenMod repository for the device.

Notes
=====

This is best used against the CM9 (ICS) source, as the CM10 (JB) source seems to have issues with the device's recovery and fails to backup/restore properly.

As of 2012.12.04, the recovery image generated with CM9 sources is the only binary to work 100%.
